"""
File name: "gridex.py"
This script provides functionality for indexing and querying GeoTIFF (.tif) files in a directory by extracting
their bounding box (MBR) and spatial reference information, and saving it in an index file (_index.csv).
It also enables querying of the index file to find GeoTIFF files that overlap with a given geometry.

Functions:

- create_index(directory):
    Scans a specified directory for .tif files, extracts their bounding boxes and spatial reference (SRID),
    and writes this information to an index file (_index.csv) in the same directory.

- get_epsg_code(dataset):
    Extracts the EPSG code (SRID) from a GeoTIFF dataset's projection information. Returns 'Unknown' if
    the SRID cannot be determined.

- query_index(directory, query_geometry):
    Reads the index file in a directory and returns a list of .tif files whose bounding boxes intersect
    with a provided query geometry in GeoJSON format.

- mbr_overlap(polygon_mbr, file_mbr):
    Checks if two bounding boxes (MBRs) overlap by comparing their minimum and maximum X/Y coordinates.

- index_directories_recursively(root_directory):
    Recursively searches through all subdirectories under the root directory for .tif files, and creates
    an index file in each directory that contains at least one .tif file. Skips directories that already
    have an _index.csv file.

- main():
    The entry point of the script. Takes a directory path as a command-line argument and recursively
    indexes all directories under the given path that contain .tif files.
